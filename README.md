# Car_Incident
This project is going to predict an car incident on the road by the different attributes, such that driver can avoid to drive through the same road to avoid incident or any delay.

This project will build a predicting system to identify the factors which are effecting traffic crash severity, predict the crash severity class based on selected factors such as weather condition, road condition, Speed and traffic control condition. Based on the result or the understanding,

Then we have the following business requirements as the purpose of project.
1.	Understand explicitly what factors led to the predicted severity class
2.	Predict Car Crash Severity class for each accident


# Data requirements
To predicting the severity class/level, we need all information related to person, vehicle and location, which covers followings as input.
1.	Weather: rain, sunny
2.	Environment: Lighting status, road condition
3.	Traffic control: Traffic light/Sign, speed zone
4.	Vehicle: car type, Speed, crash location
5.	Person involved: Numbers, Age, Gender, drug/Alcohol
6.	Location
7.	Day/time
